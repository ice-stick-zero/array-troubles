I need to process an array in order to achieve some tasks. 
  Steps:
    1. define a function to process the array
    2. upload the array to the function
    3. process the array in the function 
Troubles:
    1. what type of parameter should I write in the head of function ?
    2. what's the type of the array?
        It's some kind of pointer.
    3. what's the type of the array when it's uploaded in the function?
    4. how can I use the parameter I upload in ? just like array? or view it as address?
